The HTML file is only there to give you a quick way to judge the effect, it is NOT necessary for the effect.

To add a glitched effect to your text just grab the "textGlitch.js" file and add it to your HTML as a script. You can then add the class "glitchedText" and an attribute called "data-text" with the same content as the HTML element you're adding this to.

Tips: The base color of the text will be white, be sure to change the color or an adapted background color.
