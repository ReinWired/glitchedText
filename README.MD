This is a javascript file adding a glitching effect to text that is renewed on each iteration of the animation. The file adds all the necessary CSS by itself.

The HTML file is only there to give you a quick way to judge the effect, it is NOT required for the effect.


**USAGE**

To add a glitched effect to your text just grab the "textGlitch.js" file and add it to your HTML as a script. You can then add the class "glitchedText" and an attribute called "data-text" with the same content as the HTML element you're adding this to.

**Tip**: The base color of the text will be white, be sure to change the color or an adapted background color.
